            <p>My name is Kelsie and I’m from Whitby, Ontario and I have two older brothers Cameron and Ian, we all live with both our parents plus our dog Tucker. Back at home, I have a job at McDonald’s where I work as a manager. In my free time, I enjoy going to cafes, hanging out with friends, thrifting, and watching movies.</p>

            <p>I am a first-year student in Graphic Design at Algonquin College. I took an interest in this program because of my love for art and design. I chose Ottawa because this is known to be one of the best programs but also because I love the city, especially in the winter time with all of its activities.</p>
